                <i>"Unicorn, noun - a start-up that is valued at one Billion dollars or more"</i> (Merriam Webster). When serial investor Aileen Lee coined the term <i>Unicorn</i> for a billion-dollar-valuation more than five years ago, these companies where rare - not as rare as the term suggests, though. Over the past years, startups have evolved into well-known brands and hidden champions have developed serios valuations. This analysis tries to make use of data to show which industries are the biggest and which region is the most fruitful (Spoiler: It's <i>the Valley</i>).

                The data set used for this small project was <del>scraped</del> obtained from <a href="https://angel.co/"><i>Angel.co</i></a>. The site claims to provide information on more than four million companies, but it comes with a big asterisk: Most of the information appears to be crowd sourced and while cleaning the data, I found entries that were inconsistent. It should work out for a fun project like this one though.
                 <br>
                It's all about the Unicorns, right? Initially, I narrowed my focus to only include companies that are, according to the angel.co data, valued at one billion US-Dollars or above. But to make it a bit more fun, I included the top runner-ups as well: Companies worth 500 Million US-Dollars or more. This gave me a total of roughly 400 companies to look at.

                It is quite clear from the first graph that the United States are the dominant country in the world, even though the ranking is lead by a Chinese company. For a better perspective on how yuuuuge the US-share really is, let's take a look at the distribution of all companies in the data set by country. Note that the following two charts count the number of companies, regardless of their size.

        <p class="label-text super-font">Ok, it is clear that the US do have the most companies. But what about the distribution of funding? If we take a closer look at where the money goes, the results are staggering: California is by far the most dominant state of all - more startup funding goes to the West Coast State than to <b>all other countries combined</b>. The valley is very much alive. </p>
